## Steam Deck Time Tracker

DeckTime is a background daemon for collecting usage statistics on the Steam Deck.  
It tracks when and which games were launched, how long they were played, and saves this data for future visualization.

A separate [project](https://github.com/allexkap/deckview) for data visualization is currently in development:
